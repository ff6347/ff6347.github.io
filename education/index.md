## Advanced Technical College Entrance Qualification  

In January 2003 I reached my college entrance qualification by finishing my apprenticeship as salesman in retail.  

## Apprenticeship as Salesman in Retail  

After working several years for the company No Limits I made a apprenticeship as salesman from in August 2000 to January 2003. I worked at and managed the Titus Store Braunschweig and the No Limits store Magniviertel in that time.  

## School Part of the College Entrance Qualification

I reached the school part of my college entrance qualification at the Wilhelm Gymansium in Braunschweig. I must admit that school was a pain for me. I wasn't a good student after all. If this came from me being in puberty and feeling rebellious, having mostly very old and conservative teachers or if the system of "bulimia learning" - I can't tell.  

## Before Gymansium  

Before we reached Braunschweig my family moved a lot.  

- Orientierungsstufe Leonhardstraße Braunschweig  
- primary school Schandelah (near Braunschweig)
- primary school Kaden (between Bonn and Gießen)
- German primary school Madrid
- primary school Elliehausen (near Göttingen)
- Kindergarden Elliehausen
