The people at [Culturecode][culturedcode] updated Things from v2 to v3. There is no upgrade pricing. Which is understandable after so many years of development. I'm asking myself now: “Should I spend the 50€ (macOS + iOS) version?” The thing (lowercase) is I moved on. I didn't start Things (upper case) for a long time. I moved on to [Taskpaper][taskpaper], but even these are not part of my daily habits. After I first evaluation of the trial app, I still wasn't convinced that I should move back.

This seems the biggest challenge for me. The feeling I'm moving backward.
