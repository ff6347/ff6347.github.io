# Deutsche Bahn

I don't have a drivers license but the last few month commuting with the Deutsche Bahn from Berlin to Braunschweig makes regret that decision. 
I'm commuting since 5 grade from a little village to Braunschweig with the Bahn to get to school until I moved to the city. When I studied and worked at the FHP I commuted from 2005 till 2017 from Berlin to Potsdam. 
Not sure if I'm an old man yelling war stories but it feels like it is getting worse with the DB. 

So wroooom wroooomm? 🏍️
