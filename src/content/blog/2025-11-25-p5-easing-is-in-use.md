Yesterday I learned that Pieter-Jan Vaernewijck and his students are using my [p5js easing](https://github.com/ff6347/p5-easing) library over at [devine.be](https://www.devine.be/en/).

How did find out? I broke the build by [setting up trusted publishing to npm](/blog/2025-11-23-npm-trusted-publishing-rabbits-hole/) and they could not use the CDN unpkg version any more.

This makes me very happy.[^1]

[^1]: No. Not that I broke it and they could not use it. That people are using it. Duh!
