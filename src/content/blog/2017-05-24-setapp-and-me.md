The idea of [Setapp][setapp] is great. Having a subscription model for all those lovely apps and just paying 9.99$ per month is very intriguing. My problem is, for the apps that interest me the most in their catalog I already have a license:

- [Cleanmymac][clean] (Have it, use it, love it.)
- [Marked][markd] (no [M↓] document is written without it.)
- [Gemini][gemini] (from time to time I use it but not that often as I should.)
- [Numi][numi] (Great calculator. It is actually free.)
- [Betterzip][zip] (Also way better than the built-in archiver. And also free.)
- [Coderunner][run] (Well this is one of the apps I never use but I love the idea. normally I use the [iTerm][term] and the REPL.)
- [Base][base] (Okay this one might come in handy when I actually start using SQLite.)
- [Yummy FTP][yummy] (I have a license but I use [Transmit][transmit].)
- [Manuscript][manu] (Bought a license for that one. It really sucked. I hope it improved.)
- [Ulysses][ulysses] (I'm on [Scrivener][scriv] for this kind of writing. Even though I like the visual appearance of Ulysses more.)
- [Taskpaper][task] (Well this one I bought after the beta subscription of Setapp ran out.)

Any thoughts? Talk to me on Twitter [@fmoronzirfas][tw] about it.
