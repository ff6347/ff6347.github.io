Don't you feel that it's nuts that we are in a world where some company has an outage for one day and everyone is touched by that?  
People are complaining that the helpdesk is down or they can't access their Asana boards or whatever. This is, of course, a problem of globalization, but I see this as an implementation problem we created.  

For example, when I'm on the train and I try to open Figma to just sketch out something for a project, I can't generate a new file or access my existing files because most of our applications are designed online first.  

But if we would embrace an offline-first and then sync methodology, people could keep working or creating or reading or whatever, and we still could be on when possible, instead of always on and not possible if not on.
