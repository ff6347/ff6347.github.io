Once I saw in `/bin` a file `[`. Since I don't want to destroy the fabric of my little unixiverse I thought: Maybe some leftover of some command gone wrong or whatever. I did a `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯` and moved on.

Today I learned:

When you write a script like this:

```bash
if [ a = b ]; then
	echo "a equal to b"
fi
```

You don't use a language built in expression. You run with the executable `/bin/test`. Because `/bin/[` is an alias for `/bin/test`. The only difference is that `[` looks for the closing `]` to even things out.

So the script above could also be :

```bash
if test a = b; then
	echo "a equal to b"
fi
```
