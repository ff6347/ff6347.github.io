Why is GitHub showing all these people as contributors? What did I do ~2012 to mix my history with some other project? See https://github.com/ff6347/ff6347.github.io/graphs/contributors

```bash
❯ git log --format='%aN' | sort -u

After some digging I found that as the git noob that I was then I used some jekyll-bootstrap repo and did not remove the .git folder or something like that. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Also I had a lot of different names in my `.gitconfig` → `user.name` over the years.
