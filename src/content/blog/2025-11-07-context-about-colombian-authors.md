Yesterday, on November the 6th 2025, the  during class, I said something in the realm of "You can't understand people from the South." I want to expand on this.  It wasn't meant as an attack on all of you. I am also European, even if I don't look like that. I also can't fully grasp what it means to be from "the South".  So it should have actually been "We can't understand people from the South". [^1] I also think when reading, like Franca already urged us to, we have to take into account how the authors  where socialized. Here is some context about Colombia, which  in my opinion makes it easier to understand the desire of freeing the worlds of oppression and allow the existence of parallel realities as Alfredo Gutiérrez Borrero or Arturo Escobar suggest.

These things about Colombia I experienced myself or got told first hand from my father who was Colombian, born in 1942. He emigrated to Germany in the end of the 1960s and returned to Colombia in 2006 where he lived and thought Physics at the Universidad de Cartagena until 2016.

One thing is to understand the plurality of cultures that live in Colombia. The Caribbean coast of Colombia for example has many areas where the descendants of slaves settled. This means we have the cultures of Berbers (Amazigh), Arabs, Egyptians, Nubians, Mandinka, Malinke, Bambara, Songhai, Fulani, Wolof, Serer, Akan, Ashanti, Fante, Dagomba, Ewe, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Kanuri, Fon, Baoulé, Bété, Senufo, Bamileke, Duala, Bantu-speaking peoples. Together with the indigenous peoples from Colombia and Venezuelas, Panama and Costa Rica, and the Yucatan. Mixed with the Spanish, the French, the British. The Spanish spoken at the coast is called "costeño" and even people from other regions told me they don't understand it. Remember this is only the Caribbean coast. That is why I think I get that thought pluralism can easily grow in someone who is socialized in such an environment.

Then there is the oppression. In the colonial period through the Spanish from 1499 until ~1810 a huge part of the indigenous population was eradicated. From the 6 Million indigenous remained 600.000 in the Colombian population.
In the recent history this country has been in a constant civil war from the mid 1960 until 2016.  Many cruelties were happening from all the sides of this conflict. The communist opposition (FARC), the state, the paramilitary groups, And from the 70s on, also from the narcotic trafficking cartels. Due to the war and drugs that was proclaimed in the 70s, the United States of America also executed military actions in this sovereign country.
This creates two things in my opinion.

I got the feeling that there's a big distrust within the population against each other. People living in gated communities if they can afford that or behind bars, if not.

This creates a very strong opposition against being oppressed, being seen as "the periphery", being colonized, being the backyard of others.



[^1]: I also think we can't understand a lot of things. I can't understand feminism because I am not a woman. I can't understand Islam. I can understand racism because because I experience it.
