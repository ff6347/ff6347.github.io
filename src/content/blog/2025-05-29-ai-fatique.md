In the beginning of the current AI wave, everything that came made us go "ooohhhh" and "aaaah". We made it through the first year and generated images with a median of 12.42 fingers per person and were happy about it. We were okay to "delve" into the depths of poorly written content and saw a utopian future where none of us would have to work anymore, while the doomers were prepping their tinfoil hats and pulling their fillings so Skynet wouldn't get them.

And now? We see diffusion-based models generate large text chunks in sub-seconds with GPT-3.5+ quality, and we are like, "meh". Predictions say A{G|S}I will be here in 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 years, or never. We see "Younglings" using the "vibe force" to dream up applications that would have taken us weeks and months of crawling through Stack Overflow to cobble together, and we are mad at them because "they don't honor the platform," "this code is not production-ready and hard to maintain if you are a _real_ programmer," and "GET OFF MY WLAN, YOU DAMN KIDS!". Of course, they don't clap when the plane lands. It is normal for them that they come down now.

What I want to say with this is: it's 7:20 in the morning, and I am having a coffee, so `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
