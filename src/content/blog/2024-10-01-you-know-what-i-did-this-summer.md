So I had some time since I left the Technologiestiftung. The next semester is about to start in two weeks. Here is a recap of my summer not in chronological order

1. I found a flat. Will be moving partially soonish. Yay \o/ (it is in X-Berg again and I couldn't be happier about it. Whenever I ride through the Kiez I really feel at home)
2. Started learning more CSS with [https://cssgrid.io/](https://cssgrid.io/) and [https://css-for-js.dev/](https://css-for-js.dev/) Very nice. Can't wait to reach the animation part.
3. Incorporated some of the learnings into the syllabus for the upcoming semester.
4. Ported an [Alfred CSS color names search](https://github.com/ff6347/alfred-color-names) extension of mine [to Raycast](https://github.com/ff6347/css-color-names-raycast) and made it more useful. I use it all the time when preparing my seminar.
5. Also made a little [react app to search color names](https://colornames.inpyjamas.dev/) out of it so my students can use it as well (tried to have it on codepen.io but it is hard to maintain in one pen)
6. Went pro on codepen.io to use it for my seminar
7. Ported an [Alfred extension by typefaces](https://github.com/typefacts/alfred-special-characters/) for special characters [to Raycast](https://github.com/ff6347/raycast-special-characters)
8. Applied for the project lead role for p5.js but didn’t land that job. It’s okay. I had to try.
9. Revived some old Robert Penner easing code I once [wrote for Processing](https://github.com/ff6347/processing-easing) and [ported it to p5.js](https://easing.inpyjamas.dev/). Still working on the docs though.
10. Found out that I’m [not the only one with that idea](https://github.com/hslu-dda/p5easing). Duh. Which interface is the better one? Any opinions?
11. Toyed a little with the idea of a p5.js add on that uses ASTs to control CSS. I call it the `style()` method. Still only a POC. I need to think about what API/features I want before I start writing code.
12. Contributed a little to the new P5.js website. Boy there are so many broken links.
13. Packed nearly all the things in my mother's flat. This was rollercoaster ride of emotions in the theme park called “her life” located in her fortress of solitude.
