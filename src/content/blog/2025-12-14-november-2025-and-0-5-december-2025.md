description: "A summary about what happened in the last 45 days. Mostly master related and of course missing some things here."

So what happened this November. I will try to summarize some things that landed in my daily notes and what I did.
## Thesis Topics and Master Studies

I had some ideas for my thesis topics landing in my inbox. Here are some keywords. I might expand on this later on. 

- **Small Language Models:**  I really think this is a topic worth exploring. I already trained a SML on some personal data. 
- **Gestalt Theory:** In 2016 I did this Gestalten In Code seminar @FH;P and I want to dig deeper into this. Maybo together with SLMs?
- **Color Theory:** Same as the ones above. I want to dig into training a model for color creation
- **Learn Code the Hard Way:** For the master we need to do some teaching experience. I was thinking about a seminar that does the following. First generate code using LLMs. Second part try to write this yourself. See also  [New Kid in the Classroom: Exploring Student Perceptions of AI Coding Assistants](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.22900v4)
- **Student Paper:** I am working on a project that should end up in a student paper about: "On Device Small Language Models for Symptom Diary P.R.O. Measures" 
- **Reading Group:** We did a lot of reading about, post-colonialism, design justice, equality, oppression, pluralism and and and. All related to design. Makes we wanna ditch the term title Design a little.
- **Workshops:** There Where also some pretty interesting workshops going on.
	- Unity
	- D3
	- Spatial Typography
	- AI
	- Touch Designer
	  Below you can see some videos. I'll add no additional comments here.

- **Find a Font:** The hardest task besides naming things
