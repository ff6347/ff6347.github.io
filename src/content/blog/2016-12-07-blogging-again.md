Recent events in big data, like the usage of [Michal Kosinski research](https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/) for influencing elections, the ["hacking" of Googles search algorithms](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/04/google-democracy-truth-internet-search-facebook) for pushing right wing propaganda into search results and the development from [hyperlinked information to linear TV like consumption](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426#.y88r8rsbd) makes me sangry (sad+angry). So I will start blogging. Not on medium, not Tumblr or whatever. It will happen here. Sometimes in English, sometimes German, sometimes in Code. So stay tuned and use the RSS feed.
