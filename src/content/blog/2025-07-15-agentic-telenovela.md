Watching the telenovela of agentic coding tools is very entertaining. Cursor raising prices (or lowering access to models), OpenAI talking to Windsurf, Anthropic cutting of access to Claude for them. But then Google jumps in to pick out the leadership. Now Cognition wants a piece of the cake and slurps up the rest of Windsurf's team. Meanwhile Amazon creates silently its own agentic IDE Kiroâ€¦

What a drama!!!
