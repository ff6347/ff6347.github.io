# Rename a GitHub Repo with a Linked Netlify Project

So what needs to be done before you do that â¤´?

1. stop all builds
2. disable auto deploys on Netlify
3. rename the repo on GitHub
4. relink the repo on Netlify (should trigger a build)
5. your environment variables might be gone - set them again

**!Bonus Tip:** Don't set `NODE_ENV` on `netlify.toml`. Or your `devDepndencies` wont be installed. (:facepalm:)
