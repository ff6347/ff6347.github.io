I used to be very interested in what people were saying about AI and its current trajectory in the development community. But today I noticed that I get the feeling of: "AI is going to be blah blah blah…"

It is fine if you're totally betting on AI in development. Great show me how you do it! What worked well? What did not work? Any new learnings? And if you're against it. It's also fine right code by hand.

But please can you both shut up and stop proselytizing[^1]. There is more than one solution, my friends. My professor and mentor recently said something in the realm of: "whenever I read the word inevitable, I start to doubt."

Yes. Stop thinking in your binary, black or white, all or nothing method.

[^1]: yes. I looked this word up with AI.
