Marble Fountain by Will Morrison

Very beautiful work and great presentation. Via [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45866697)

> Finally, a huge thanks to my friend Alex who listened to me ramble about marbles for several months every day while walking home from work, gave a ton of helpful input, and lived with the dozens of ball bearings scattered across our apartment.

Yes thanks Alex! :D
