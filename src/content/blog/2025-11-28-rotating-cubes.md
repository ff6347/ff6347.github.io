This is something I quickly vibe coded on the way home from Potsdam. It is based on some other students results from the Unity XR workshp at FH Potsdam. I liked the stacked cubes idea. But what intrigued me the most was the artifacts that came from the low quality rendering in the Oculus Quest 2. This wasn't intended by the others. 
To remind me of this effect I created this artifact in threejs.
Bottom line. Use the restrictions and limitations of a system to create effects. Not every effect/look needsto be inteded See [the live version here](https://ff6347.github.io/loficubed/) and the [source code here](https://github.com/ff6347/loficubed). It is **DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSED**
