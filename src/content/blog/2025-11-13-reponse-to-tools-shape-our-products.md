Hi Boris, in your article [Tools Shape Our Products](https://borism.medium.com/tools-shape-our-products-fa121366dac4) you argue that the code editor is this arcane empty text field we are staring at when coding. In my opinion you are exaggerating (maybe to make your point?).

When I open a Terminal. It does not look like this anymore:

It looks more like this:

And also the editor. We are not using the plainest of plain text.

It is actually more like this.

There is so much information and tooling to make my life easier. Debuggers, Breakpoints, Linters, Code Formatters, Static Typing, Code Generators. The list goes on. Even the color of the words I type contain information about what I am doing. when I type the application suggest what I could type next based on context.

But I get your point.
