I've been wanting to built this [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) extension for quite some time from my Alfred extension that does the same. So here it is! Woohoo \o/

Allows you to filter through named CSS colors. Installation currently only by cloning and installing via import. I need to iron out some ideas before submitting to the raycast store.
