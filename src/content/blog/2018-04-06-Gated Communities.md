Whenever I come across a Facebook link I feel like: "ohh noooo, this path leeds into a gated community, where the land lord has cameras in your house and collects your trash and comes to your house when you sleep to look at your undies. Lucky me - I live in the woods where everyone can pass through my camp."[^1] In other words:

[^1]: Yes they also can look at my stuff but I try to keep my undies in my backpack and I check for hidden cameras.
