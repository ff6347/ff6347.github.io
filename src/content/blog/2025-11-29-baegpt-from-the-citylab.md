I am really proud of my friends over at CityLAB and Technologiestiftung Berlin for getting this up and running. A custom made solution for using large language models in the Berlin administration ☞ [BärGPT](https://www.baergpt.berlin/). I have been watching from the sideline how this came to life. A great piece of work. Read this as well [BärGPT: The technical Deep Dive for the new AI assistant for Berlin’s public administration](https://citylab-berlin.org/en/blog/baergpt-the-technical-deep-dive-for-the-new-ai-assistant-for-berlins-public-administration/)

And you know what? The whole thing is [open source](https://github.com/technologiestiftung/baergpt).

Chapeau my friends!
